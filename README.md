# Unity-txt-to-speech

A Unity Application created to demonstrate text to speech via a talking 3D model.

- 3-D model's with animations and blend shapes, combined with its rigging, enable the model to appear to speak.
- Crosstales and Crazy Minnow Studio Unity Plugins are used to project the video and simulate speaking and blinking.

Feel free to use this as a basis to create your own talking 3-D model. Connected to an AI, the possibilities are endless to what can be done.
